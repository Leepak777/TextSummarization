# TextSummarization
Have you ever read a stroy or a news article and thought "hmmm, I wish it could be shorter so I can read it faster" ? 
Well, we got you, this app allows you to copy any desired text and summarize it.
What's even better is that we will translate every sentence in the summary to a different language for users to learn!
There are 109 languages the program will randomly translate to!
Feel like a paragraph of summary is still too long?
Don't worry, we have an option that will summarise the summary for you!
The program will summarize the summary then summarize the summarized summary then summarize the summarized summarized summary then summarize the summarized summarized summarized summary then...
It will keep summarizing until you can understand a 1000 words long article with only a sentence
